Memecoins seem to be on the rise again. This week WhaleAlert reported that Binance sent 4 trillion Shiba Inu, worth around $35 million, to an unknown wallet to stake the token. It was one of the largest transactions made for Shiba Inu tokens.

<b>Burning money</b>: It is certainly unconventional for the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange to stake such a large amount of tokens on a memecoin, but it can be assumed that the decision was influenced by the recent update announcement made by Shiba. The creators of the Shibarium Network (SHIB’s to-be-launched layer-2 scaling protocol) declared that Bone ShibaSwap (BONE) would be the new official digital currency operated on the blockchain. Every Shibarium transaction will also burn SHIB tokens. Burning is common practice by many cryptocurrency networks to establish a deflationary crypto, which are tokens limited in supply but high in demand.

Following this news of Binance’s staking, Shiba Inu coin price surged 5%, also increasing the trading volume by 77% at $450 million. CoinMarketCap briefly listed SHIB on the #1 spot, which ranks assets based on price, 24-hour and 7-day price change, volume, and circulating supply.

<b>#BONK</b>: BONK token was crypto’s latest hype. Launched in December on Solana network, BONK’s value has pumped 2500% since the launch, after plunging 60%. The absurd rise and fall of BONK may well represent the volatility, and the pump-and-dump nature of crypto, but it did bring a positive change in reviving the Solana blockchain network. With more than 50% of Bonk tokens airdropped to Solana NFT projects and Solana blockchain developers, it compensated many who still remained with Solana, after the rough series of events they went through following FTX collapse that plunged the price 94%. The quick rise of BONK served as a temporary halt and a boost to Solana, with SOL increasing 60% in value since the new year and regaining a position in top 10 cryptocurrencies by market cap.

<b>FOMO</b>: The past few weeks have shown that people are still willing to jump onto any crypto hype, and how FOMO marketing is here to stay. If a memecoin is enough to revive a dying blockchain, we may possibly see even more short-lived projects come up, for the sole purpose of making another crypto project relevant.
