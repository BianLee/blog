Auburn is a small town just north of Sacramento, and it's quite the perfect daytrip location. My friend and I took Amtrak one early Saturday morning to spend a day here.

You can find numerous cutesy caf√©s and restaurants in the "downtown" area surrounding the Placer County Courthouse, the "landmark" building of the city. See the top photo.

Always grab a cup of latte at a local caf√©.

The whole town has a very <i>Americana</i> feel to it ‚Äî which I absolutely love. You don't often see towns like this in Southern California.

That's an absolutely lovely shot right there. Shout out to my friend @photokuang for the photos.

After doing a quick hike up the hill / mountain, we saw residential areas (like above) on the way down.
