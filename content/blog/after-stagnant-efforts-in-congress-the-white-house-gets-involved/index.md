<b>The story</b>: The White House has published a new roadmap that increases regulation in the crypto sector, blaming the Congress for its failures in enacting enforcements. President Biden’s senior advisors wrote an official blog titled “The Administration’s Roadmap to Mitigate Cryptocurrencies’ Risks”, the post recommends strengthening regulatory institutions like the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as well as the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), and enacting laws strictly for regulating stablecoins.

It’s been about a year since the President signed the Executive Order on “Ensuring Responsible Development of Digital Assets”, contrary to the expectations, this bill actually held generally positive views towards crypto, a rare stance by governments.

<b>Change in positions</b>: Today, however, the new roadmap seems to take on a different side. It is calling for heavier regulations including strengthening disclosure requirements, and increasing penalties for misconduct. Almost certainly this is an outcome of the FTX crash, which caught attention from government agencies. First, it was the Congress and its bipartisan legislation that called for extreme measures in restricting crypto services. There have been few push backs in response, especially from Sen. Pat Toomey and Ted Cruz who continued their vocal support of crypto and innovation. With no legislation actually being passed, the Executive Branch stepped in to make a statement and bring changes.

The blog does not include specific details of how they will enforce new regulations and what the timeline would look like. While the propositions mentioned are not as extreme and unreasonable as the bipartisan bill, the move doesn’t seem so appropriate in a time where the industry is in a recovery phase. The crypto sector has grown significantly over the recent years, and the government should recognize that it’s in everyone’s best interest to see it thriving again. Regulations can come later, but the immediate action should be to help revive the honest and responsible businesses that were hurt by recent misconduct of a few firms. The concern is that rushed and spontaneous enforcement could kill off the industry at its vulnerable state and lead to worse consequences for all.
