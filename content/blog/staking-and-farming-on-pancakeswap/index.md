<i>40% APR go brrrr. CAKE makes our world go round!</i>

Pancakeswap (pancakeswap.finance) is one of my favorite DeFi products at the moment and I'm heavily invested in the project, with over $1K USD worth of tokens staked on this DEX. In this post, I talk about what my portfolio looks like and how I use this product to manage my crypto assets. Treat it as an unofficial guide made by a passionate user.

Like many others, I discovered Pancakeswap after Uniswap's rising popularity. I first learned about the concept of Automated Market Maker (AMM) in a podcast with Hayden Adams (Uniswap founder), leading me to Uniswap.org. For a while I kept hearing buzz words like <i>impermanent loss</i>, <i>liquidity provider</i>, <i>LP staking</i> and other confusing terms. I understood none of it then, but it did make me see that there was a whole world of finance I was missing out on. 

Pancakeswap's appeal (over other DEXes like Uniswap) is its low gas fee, made possible through the Binance Smart Chain (BSC). BSC can handle 50 transactions per second (better than Ethereum blockchain's 30 TPS) at less than ~$0.35 per transaction. I also personally love the whole theme and design behind the product: The colorful graphics, cute bunny logo, and fitting terminology (<i>Syrup pools</i>, <i>chefs</i>). The front end almost looks like an arcade or some video game app, rather than a financial exchange. It's honestly fitting for the DeFi Degens folks (like myself).

<b>Depositing & Cashing Out</b><br/>
Moving funds in and out of DeFi platforms is often frustrating. Here's the method I use: Buy ETH on Coinbase ‚Üí send ETH to MetaMask ‚Üí send ETH to Binance.US ‚Üí convert ETH for BNB ‚Üí send BNB back to MetaMask ‚Üí Connect to Pancakeswap. When cashing out, you do the exact opposite.

<b>Syrup Pools</b><br/>
Around Christmas time (last year), my brother and I pooled money (<i>get it?</i>) to buy up $CAKE, when it was trading at around $3.3 per token. SBF has pretty much wiped out crypto market by this point, so I knew it was time to accumulate. Locking CAKE for a long time gets you crazy APR (currently, it's at 41.8%) so I selected the maximum time (52 weeks) and put it away for good. I'm willing to do this because I am bullish about CAKE. As long as CAKE doesn't depreciate in value by over 40% by the end of the year, I profit or break even. My stakes unlock on December 22 of this year, so I'll treat it as Christmas present. 

<b>Farms</b><br/>
Here's my current portfolio of my position in Farms.

| # | Staked LP Farm | APR | Current Value |
| :--------- | :-- | ---: | ---: |
| 1 | ZBC-CAKE LP | 75.49% | $921.70 |
| 2 | BNB-CAKE LP | 16.07% | $100 |

Here's the reasoning behind choosing these two pools. Between the two, BNB-CAKE is a lot more stable, because the two tokens definitely have direct price correlations.
