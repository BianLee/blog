Last September, Ethereum’s Merge was executed, adopting a whole new proof-of-stake (PoS) protocol in place of the existing proof-of-work (PoW) system. It allowed investors to stake Ethereum for a chance to verify transactions on the network and be rewarded with more ETH. The next big system upgrade, called Shanghai hard fork, is scheduled for March. It is the last stage in Ethereum’s three-step efforts in transitioning to PoS blockchain, coming after “London” and “Berlin” forks that successfully executed last year.

The significance of Shanghai fork is that it allows Ethereum stakers / validators (who had deposited 32 ETH) to finally withdraw their funds from the Beacon Chain. The total amount of ETH staked is estimated to be 15 million ETH (worth over $19 billion USD), which represents around 12.5% of the entire ETH supply. The upgrade also includes major updates to Ethereum blockchain’s Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), a distributed state machine that keeps record of public transaction ledger.

There are many price speculations regarding ETH, and it’s reasonable to predict a price rally in the weeks leading up to the event. This is what happened before The Merge; with great optimism and anticipation, ETH went on a bull run, peaking at over $2k and recovering from the $800 price slash that was in result of the Terra-Luna crash earlier in the year. Yet, it was a different story following the actual execution; Despite the success, the price of ETH fell instead, and has not recovered since the FTX collapse. While Ethereum certainly became more energy-efficient, the hype leading up to the event seemed to have overvalued the short-term pricing of ETH. The “news traders” essentially “bought-the-rumor and sold-the-news.” A similar scenario could play out with the Shanghai update, with price reaching its peak at the beginning of March, before the actual upgrade.

This is, however, more applicable to short-term traders than holders. I have no doubt about ETH being bullish in the long-run, given all the technical upgrades it has gone through. Successful completion of Shanghai upgrade will assure investors of the safety in staking, and we’ll likely observe a greater percentage of staked Ether.

As of today, 12.5% of total supply being staked is relatively lower in comparison to other Proof-of-Stake blockchains like Cardano (71.8%) and Solana (71.4%). This percentage will likely change soon. In addition, reduction in gas fees would significantly help grow Ethereum’s DeFi ecosystem, and attract a greater number of developers to build. Ethereum’s high transaction fees have always received criticism, and it has also led to many choosing other networks like BSC to build decentralized applications. This, too, could change. A few firm believers predict that Ethereum will eventually overtake Bitcoin as the most valued crypto. While I don’t see this happening anytime soon, it is not an unreasonable argument.
