<i>40% APR go brrrr. CAKE makes our world go round!</i>

Pancakeswap (pancakeswap.finance) is one of my favorite DeFi products at the moment and I'm heavily invested in it, with over $1K USD worth of tokens staked on this DEX. In this post, I talk about what my portfolio looks like and how I use this product to manage my crypto assets. Treat it as an unofficial guide made by a passionate user.

Like many others, I discovered Pancakeswap after Uniswap's rising popularity. I first learned about the concept of Automated Market Maker (AMM) in a podcast with Hayden Adams (Uniswap founder), leading me to Uniswap.org. For a while I kept hearing buzz words like <i>impermanent loss</i>, <i>liquidity provider</i>, <i>LP staking</i> and other confusing terms. I understood none of it then, but it did make me see that there was a whole world of finance I was missing out on. 

Pancakeswap's appeal (over other DEXes like Uniswap) is its low gas fee, made possible through the Binance Smart Chain (BSC). BSC can handle 50 transactions per second (better than Ethereum blockchain's 30 TPS) at less than ~$0.35 per transaction. I also personally love the whole theme and design behind the product: The colorful graphics, cute bunny logo, and fitting terminology (<i>Syrup pools</i>, <i>chefs</i>). The front end almost looks like an arcade or some video game app, rather than a financial exchange. Honestly fitting for the Defi Degens.

<b>Depositing & Cashing Out</b><br/>
Moving funds in and out of DeFi platforms is often frustrating. Here's the method I use: Buy ETH on Coinbase ‚Üí send ETH to MetaMask ‚Üí send ETH to Binance.US ‚Üí convert ETH for BNB ‚Üí send BNB back to MetaMask ‚Üí Connect to Pancakeswap. When cashing out, you do the exact opposite. Yes, it's tedious and you will lose small percentage of funds from transaction fees. But I assure going through few extra steps to keep crypto <i>decentralized</i>, is worth it. <i>Not your keys, not your crypto!</i>

<b>Swap</b><br/>
Swapping one asset for another is a simple enough process, requiring just few clicks. Always use limit orders (to get best rates), and always have some BNB available in metamask at all times. I personally have made the mistake of locking away all my BNB and having none to use for transaction fees, forcing me to tediously move around couple dollars from Coinbase, Binance.US and metamask just to have some gas money. I've also seen people on discord begging each other to send them small amount of BNB so they could make transactions. It's especially frustrating if you live in places like Texas where Binance.US is outlawed by jurisdiction, making them hard to acquire tokens. Always have BNB to save some pain.

<b>Syrup Pools</b><br/>
Around Christmas time (last year), my brother and I pooled money (no pun intended) to buy up $CAKE, when it was trading at around $3.3 per token. SBF has pretty much wiped out crypto market by this point, so I knew it was time to accumulate. Locking CAKE for a long time gets you crazy APR (currently, it's at 41.8%) so I selected the maximum time (52 weeks) and put it away for good. I'm willing to do this because I am bullish about CAKE. As long as CAKE doesn't depreciate in value by over 40% by the end of the year, I profit or break even. My stakes unlock on December 22 of this year, so I'll treat it as Christmas present. 

<b>Farms</b><br/>
This is my current farm holdings.

| # | Staked LP Farm | APR | Current Value |
| :--------- | :-- | ---: | ---: |
| 1 | ZBC-CAKE LP | 75.49% | $100 |
| 2 | BNB-CAKE LP | 16.07% | $921.70 |


Here's the reasoning behind choosing these two pools. Between the two, BNB-CAKE is a lot more stable, because the two tokens definitely have direct price correlations. It's safe to assume that if Binance fails, CAKE will go down with it. Conversely, success in Binance can only mean good things for Pancakeswap, leading to bullish CAKE. The reason you care about relative price movements is due to the risk of Impermanent Loss. Price of each asset is determined based on the quantity and the individual value in the liquidity pool (containing both BNB and CAKE). This is mathematically defined by constant product formula, which is simply `X * Y = K` in which `X` and `Y` represent the two tokens, and `K` is the total amount of liquidity. Impermanent Loss arises from this unique mechanisms of liquidity pools, and you essentially want two assets to move together in value. 

For example, suppose token A valued at $1 and token B at $2 suddenly became $50 and $2, respectively. Basically, token A went 50x while B remained the same. Then, the impermanent loss is 72.27%. While you still make money, it would have been far better to have simply held onto the two tokens instead of providing liquidity to a pool. You essentially lost out on opportunity cost.

Going back to my Farm positions, I believe BNB-CAKE offers great APR for stable relative price movements. Neither tokens are memecoins, but instead they are utility assets that power useful services. One perk to CAKE farms (CAKE-BNB, CAKE-BUSD, CAKE-USDT) is that it gives yield booster, when CAKE is simultaneously being staked in syrup pool. This gives slight increase in CAKE harvests in the farm.
    
As for ZBC-CAKE, you could think of it more so as a bit of gamble. High APR implies great volatility and risk of impermanent loss, but with small enough funds it's a bet I'm willing to take. I also made sure to enter when ZBC was cheap.

<b>Predictions (Binary Options)</b><br/>
I used to love playing predictions and I think it's a solid product, but I wouldn't waste time on it. 5-min time interval is simply too short to make wise bets. When I attempted technical analysis on it, I looked at short-term support & resistance, TEMA (moving average), and Stochastic RSI. It somewhat worked, meaning my win-rates were over 60%, but here was the problem: When risk-reward ratio is only around 1:1.3 (1.3x payout), there is simply no way you'll profit long run. Consistent 1:2 ratio would be nicer, since that means as long as you have good win-rates, you're winning long run.

I can still think of one good use case of predictions. In instances of crazy bull run, or extreme price crashes (going well beyond support / resistance levels), you can continue placing bets in one direction with high assurance. I did this once in early January when crypto was rapidly recovering (remember BTC going from 17K to 22k+) and everything was green for a while. When played during price crashes, it could also be a good tool for hedging.

<b>To wrap up...</b><br/>
I've loved pancakeswap since the beginning and I'm amongst the 1.6 million users this DEX receives every month. The world of crypto is said to be Wild West, but Pancakeswap is proof that there definitely are safe and stable projects that can withstand hardships and still come out on top.
